## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) protection using Spring Security 6.
- This lesson involves implementing and understanding CSRF protection mechanisms to prevent malicious attacks.
- In achieving this, the following concepts were implemented:
    - CSRF Token Generation - Spring Security automatically generates and manages CSRF tokens;
    - CSRF Token Validation - Configuring Spring Security to validate CSRF tokens on state-changing requests (POST, PUT,
      DELETE);
    - CSRF Token Integration - Including CSRF tokens in HTML forms and AJAX requests;
    - CSRF Configuration - Customizing CSRF protection settings and understanding when to disable it for certain
      endpoints;
    - Template Integration - Using Thymeleaf to automatically include CSRF tokens in forms
